# Climate change and temperature anomalies 

Data obtained:
- Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies in the Northern Hemisphere at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies (https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp).
- Tabular data of temperature anomalies (https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt)

Temperature anomalies reference, or base, period is the period between 1951-1980.

```{r weather_data, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE}

weather <- 
  read_csv("https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv", 
           skip = 1, 
           na = "***")

```


```{r tidyweather}
#selecting the months only
dates <- weather %>% 
  select(Year:Dec)

#converting dataframe to 'variables'long' format
tidyweather <- dates %>% 
  pivot_longer(col = Jan:Dec,
               names_to= "Month",
               values_to = "delta")

glimpse(tidyweather)
```


## An Increase in Weather Anomaly Throughout the Century

```{r scatter_plot}
#creating new variables to ensure that delta values are plot chronologically
tidyweather_2 <- tidyweather %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), Month, "1")),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))

#Plotting the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trend line
ggplot(tidyweather_2, aes(x= date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "An Increase in Weather Anomaly Throughout the Century"
  , y = "Temperature Deviation", x = "Year")


```

> The overall trend indicates that there is an increased level of temperature/weather anomaly throughout time. We suspect that the greenhouse effect on earth could be one of the reasons why the delta value could be rising over time.


## Every Month has a Similar Weather Anomaly Trend
```{r facet_wrap}
#ordering the month, to make reading the data set in plot easier to read
tidyweather_2$Month = factor(tidyweather_2$Month, levels= c("Jan","Feb","Mar","Apr","May", "Jun", "Jul" ,"Aug","Sep","Oct","Nov" ,"Dec"))

#creating a scatterplot and line of best fit with geomsmooth
ggplot(tidyweather_2, aes(x=date, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color="red") +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~Month) +
  labs (
    title = "Every Month has a Similar Weather Anomaly Trend", y= "Temperature Deviation", x= "Month")

```

> Overall, the effect of increasing temperature has a similar trend throughout the months. However, it seems to be the most pronounced in the first quarter of the year (January-March.) It is also evident that in January, February, March and November there is a large variation in the data points as the data is more spread out.


## Present Day Data Shows a Bigger Variation in Temperature\n Anomalies Than Ever Before

```{r,intervals}

comparison <- tidyweather %>% 
  filter(Year>= 1881) %>% 
  #create new variable 'interval', and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ "1881-1920",
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ "1921-1950",
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ "1951-1980",
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ "1981-2010",
    TRUE ~ "2011-present"
  ))

```
```{r, density_plot}

#creating a density plot
ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs ( x="Temperature Deviation", title = "Present Day Data Shows a Bigger Variation in Temperature\n Anomalies Than Ever Before",
    y     = "Density" 
  )

```

> Approximately, all of the intervals shown display a normal distribution. As displayed, it is observable that the '1981-2010' and '2011-present' interval are the two intervals with the widest base. This implies that they have the most volatile temperature anomalies. We believe that this could be due to global warming. 


## Steep Increase of Temperature Deviation in the Past 5 Decades 
```{r averaging}

#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly <- tidyweather %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = "Steep Increase of Temperature Deviation in the Past 5 Decades",
    y     = "Average Annual Temperature Deviation"
  )                         


```

> For the past 50 years, temperature deviation value has been increasing at an alarming rate.
