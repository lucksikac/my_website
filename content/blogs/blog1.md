title: The World Through My Lens, Greece Diving Site
---

An underwater archway diving trip at Paleokastritsa, Corfu, Greece. It hosts numerous rock alleyways and caves for diving enthusiasts to explore the natural scenery created by volcanic eruptions in the past. I would definitely recommend this diving site for those who seek for challenging divings as you would have to balance yourself very carefully to go through each cave and alleyway.
