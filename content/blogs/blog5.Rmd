## Using a choropleth plot to show the degree of mask acceptance in the US

Github source for data https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/mask-use


## Getting the data 

```{r, read_data}
#Source for data 
url <- "https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/raw/master/mask-use/mask-use-by-county.csv"
#naming the data
nyt_mask_survey <- read_csv(url)

#cleaning the data and setting up new variables to make the data more understandable
nyt_mask_survey <- nyt_mask_survey %>%
  clean_names() %>% 
  mutate(
    mostly_yes= frequently+always,
    mostly_no = never+rarely,
    delta = mostly_yes-mostly_no
  )

glimpse(nyt_mask_survey)
```

## Creating a maps, makes the data more digestable and understandable

The FIPS code is a federal code that numbers states and territories of the US. It extends to the county level with an additional four digits, so every county in the US has a unique six-digit identifier, where the first two digits represent the state. 

We will be using Kieran Healy's `socviz` package which among other things contains `county_map` and `county_data`  

```{r}
# America’s choropleths; use county_map that has all polygons 
# and county data with demographics/election data from socviz datafile
# The id field is the FIPS code for the county
county_map %>% 
  sample_n(5)

county_data %>%
    sample_n(5)


glimpse(county_data)
# we have data on 3195 FIPS....

glimpse(county_map)
# ... but to create a map, we translate these 3195 counties to 191,382 polygons!

```

## Combining the files

So far, we have three files

1. `nyt_mask_survey`, our NYT survey data, 
1. `county_map` that has all polygons that define a county
1. `county_data` with demographics/election data.

Later on we will be combing the data so that we will be able to colour down each demographics of the United States (by using the on 2. county_map and 3. county_data) depending on their face mask preference. This is called the choropleth plot/map.

```{r, join_data}

county_full <- left_join(county_map, county_data, by = "id")

county_masks_full <- left_join(county_full, nyt_mask_survey, 
                                by = c("id"="countyfp"))
```

## Building the choropleth plot

```{r, plot_choropleths}
#building the plot by using the ggplot, where we have coloured the difference preference with a gradient colour so that it makes everything more readable. 

p <- ggplot(data = county_masks_full,
            mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,
                          fill = delta, 
                          group = group))

p1 <- p + 
  geom_polygon(color = "gray90", size = 0.05) + 
  coord_equal()

p2 <- p1 + 
  scale_fill_gradient(low = '#ffffcc', high= '#006837')

p3 <- p1 + 
  scale_fill_gradient2()

# get different colours from https://colorbrewer2.org/
# the one shown here is https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=diverging&scheme=BrBG&n=6
p4 <- p1 + 
  scale_fill_gradientn(colours = c('#8c510a','#d8b365','#f6e8c3','#c7eae5','#5ab4ac','#01665e'))

p1
p2
p3
p4


p4 + labs(fill = "Mask acceptance, (Mostly Yes - Mostly No)", 
          caption = "“Estimates from The New York Times, based on roughly 250,000 interviews \nconducted by Dynata from July 2 to July 14, 2020”") +
  guides(fill = guide_legend(nrow = 1)) + 
  theme_map() + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```
