# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
```


## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r, eda_on_weight}
skim(yrbss)
```

```{r}

#a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise
yrbss1 <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))

#count the number of no's and yes's and the probability of each one
yrbss_summary <- yrbss1 %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count))

```

```{r, boxplot}
#sum population
count_pop <- yrbss_summary  %>%  
  summarise(sum = sum(count))
#calculating the SE
se_pop <- sqrt(yrbss_summary$prop[1] * (1-yrbss_summary$prop[1])/count_pop)
#calculating the mean
mean_pop <- se_pop/sqrt(count_pop)
#t-critical value, 95% con
t_critical <- qt(c(0.025, 0.975), df=count_pop$sum-1)
lower_ci <- mean_pop - t_critical * se_pop
upper_ci <- mean_pop + t_critical * se_pop

yrbss_clean <- na.omit(yrbss1)
bp_physical_3plus <- yrbss_clean %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = physical_3plus,y = weight)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs( x = "Do the students excerise more than 3 times a week?", y= "Student weight", title = "Surprisingly, students who excerise often weigh more on average!") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  theme_bw()

bp_physical_3plus

```


## Confidence Interval

```{r}
yrbss_confidence_interval <- yrbss1 %>%
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>%
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight, na.rm = TRUE), #na.rm = TRUE removes all the NA values
            sd_weight = sd(weight, na.rm=TRUE),
            count = n(),
            se_weight = sd_weight/sqrt(count),
            t_critical = qt(c(0.025, 0.975), df=count_pop$sum-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_weight,
            lower = mean_weight - margin_of_error,
            upper = mean_weight + margin_of_error
            )

yrbss_confidence_interval %>%
  kbl(col.names = c("Does student exercise 3 times a week or not?", "Mean Weight", "Stand Deviation of Weight", "Count", "Standard Error of Weight","T value", "Margin of Error", "Lower CI", "Upper CI")) %>%
  kable_material(c("striped", "hover")) %>%
  kable_styling(fixed_thead = T, full_width = FALSE)
```
> There is an observed difference of about 1.77kg (68.4 - 66.7), and we notice that the two confidence intervals do not overlap. It seems that the difference is at least 95% statistically significant.


## Hypothesis test with formula

Write the null and alternative hypotheses for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least times a week and those who donâ€™t.

```{r}

#The null and alternative hypothesis for testing whether mean weights are different for those who exercise at least three times a week and those who don't

t.test(weight ~ physical_3plus, data = yrbss1)
```

## Hypothesis test with `infer`

Next, we will introduce a new function, `hypothesize`, that falls into the infer workflow. You will use this method for conducting hypothesis tests.

But first, we need to initialize the test, which we will save as `obs_diff`.

```{r}
obs_diff <- yrbss1 %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

```{r}
null_dist <- yrbss1 %>%
  specify(weight ~ physical_3plus) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>% #permute to quantify the null distribution
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("yes", "no"))

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = null_dist, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram() +labs(x= "Difference between two population means (weight & frequency of exercise (>3 times per week))", title = "Null hypothesis as a test for independence between weight and frequency\n of exercise demonstrates a normal distribution") +theme_bw()
```
> A visualisation of the null distribution shows a normal distribution. 


```{r}

null_dist %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two-sided") + theme_bw()

null_dist %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```
> With an approximate p-value of 0, we would be rejecting the null hypothesis. This implies that there is a difference between the two population means, ie weight of student and the frequency of physical exercise.
